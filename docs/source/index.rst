Welcome to the Corda documentation!
===================================

.. warning:: This build of the docs is from the *master branch*, not a milestone release. It may not reflect the
   current state of the code. `Read the docs for M6 <https://docs.corda.net/releases/release-M6.0/>`_.

This is the developer guide for Corda, a proposed architecture for distributed ledgers. Here are the sources
of documentation you may find useful, from highest level to lowest:

1. The `Introductory white paper`_ describes the motivating vision and background of the project. It is the kind
   of document your boss should read. It describes why the project exists and briefly compares it to alternative
   systems on the market.
2. The `Technical white paper`_ describes the entire intended design from beginning to end. It is the kind of
   document that you should read, or at least, read parts of. Note that because the technical white paper
   describes the intended end state, it does not always align with the implementation.
3. This user guide. It describes *how* to use the system to write apps, as currently implemented. It assumes
   you already have read the relevant sections of the technology white paper and now wish to learn how to use it.
4. The `API docs`_.
